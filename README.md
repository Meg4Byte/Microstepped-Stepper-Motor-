## Project Description

This project simulates a two-phase stepper motor with microstepping using MicroCap12. It aims to demonstrate the control of a stepper motor with microstepping, visualize output signals on waveforms, and provide an accurate model of a stepper motor. The project is designed to offer hands-on experience for those interested in control theory and how does stepper motor achieve such small angles.

## Features

- Control stepper motor with microstepping
- Visualize microstepping signals
- Display output signals: motor acceleration, velocity, torque, and angle
- Input signals: sine and cosine voltages for microstepping
- Accurate simulation model of a stepper motor

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install MicroCap12:**
   - Download and install MicroCap12 from MicroCap's official website

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stepper-motor-simulation.git
